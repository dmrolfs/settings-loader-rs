## Publication Steps (Ready to Execute)

### Step 1: Verify One Last Time (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/rolfs/Documents/dev/dmrolfs/settings-loader-rs

# Verify on main branch
git branch
# Output should show: * main

# Run final tests
cargo test --lib --all-features
# Expected: 350 passed; 0 failed

# Check clippy
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
# Expected: 0 warnings

# Verify dry-run
cargo publish --dry-run
# Expected: successful verification, "aborting upload due to dry run"
```

### Step 2: Publish to Crates.io

```bash
# Must have crates.io authentication configured
# If not logged in:
cargo login

# Publish (no --dry-run flag)
cargo publish
```

**Expected output**:
```
   Uploading settings_loader v1.0.0
   Updating crates.io index
   ✓ Published to crates.io
```

**Time**: ~2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Verify on Crates.io (Immediate)

```bash
# Open in browser:
# https://crates.io/crates/settings_loader/1.0.0

# Check version appears in list
# Click to verify:
# - Version: 1.0.0
# - Downloads count updating
# - Dependencies listed correctly
# - Features visible
```

### Step 4: Verify Docs.rs (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Wait ~5-10 minutes, then check:
# https://docs.rs/settings_loader/1.0.0/

# Verify:
# - Documentation renders
# - All modules visible
# - Code examples render
# - Feature gate docs correct
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Push main branch
git push origin main

# Push v1.0.0 tag
git push origin v1.0.0

# Verify tag on GitHub:
# https://github.com/dmrolfs/settings-loader-rs/releases/tag/v1.0.0
```

### Step 6: Create GitHub Release (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub repo: https://github.com/dmrolfs/settings-loader-rs
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Use existing tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `settings-loader v1.0.0`
5. Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md [1.0.0] section
6. Mark as: Latest release
7. Click "Publish release"

## Rollback Instructions

**If needed before crates.io publish**:
1. Simply fix the issue
2. Re-run tests and dry-run
3. Can re-publish with same version

**If needed after crates.io publish**:
1. Cannot yank v1.0.0 (stable release policy)
2. Must publish v1.0.1 as patch release if critical issue
3. Document the issue in CHANGELOG.md

---

## Important Notes

1. **Cannot be undone**: Once published to crates.io, v1.0.0 is permanent
2. **Dry-run verified**: Publication pathway is confirmed working
3. **All tests passing**: 350+ tests ensure quality
4. **Backward compatible**: Existing code using v0.15.0 works without changes
5. **Production ready**: 8,613 lines, comprehensive test coverage, full documentation
